# WebAppDemo
Demo of a business web application.

I started this over a weekend piecing together some stuff I have learned working on business web apps for the past 6 months. The goal is to put together a sizeable demonstration of common functionalities in these types of applications.


## Progress as of 04/22/2019:

  - Put together a simple backend that features a hardcoded data access layer (DAL) that is meant to mimic a access to a db.
    I decided to do this so that the project could be pulled from github and run on anyone's localhost without any problems
    with configuring EF with a SQL db.
    
  - Added client-side search and limited filtering functionality to DemoPage. Will write an example of an ajax call later on this week.
